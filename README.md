Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment System for Marginalized Areas

A.	Description
This project is based one of the UN SDGS that is availability of clean water and sanitation. 
For instance, in marginalized areas human beings often share the share same water source with animals hence the chance of water contamination is high. In some areas people use sewage water for their normal daily routine, this has increased water related diseases. Bad enough industrial and sewage water is released into rivers thus there is an urge to offer a solution to such incidences.
 The system (Hydro Track) will be designed to help track and assess the quality of water sources in marginalized areas. 
The system can collect data (e.g., pH levels, turbidity, and contamination levels) and evaluate if a water source is safe for consumption.
 
  Main Objectives:  
1.	Educate users about water quality parameters.
2.	 Provide recommendations based on water quality data.
 
 
 Basic Features: 
User input for water quality parameters: pH, turbidity, contaminants.
Analysis: Check if the input values fall within safe ranges as per WHO standards.
 Provide feedback like: "Water drinking." "Water is unsafe; please filter or boil."
 Suggestions:
 Recommend simple purification methods based on detected issues.
 Data Visualization for trends and insights
 Use matplotlib to create charts showing water quality trends.
 Database Integration for persistent storage
Web Interface for interactions



Real-World Application
1.	Policy Advocacy
          NGOs and local governments use the system to monitor water sources  prioritize unsafe locations, and distribute resources for purification or repair.
2.	 Individuals in rural and urban areas can input test results and get immediate feedback on water safety.
3.	 Data trends allow researchers to study the correlation between water quality and public health outbreaks like cholera or lead poisoning.
4.	 Businesses (e.g., bottled water suppliers) can use the system to track compliance with water quality regulations.
5.	Public Health Improvement: Prevent waterborne diseases like cholera, typhoid, and dysentery by identifying and addressing unsafe water sources.
6.	Community Awareness: Educate communities about water quality issues and empower them with purification techniques.





B. Project Workflow

1.	Objectives
o	Track and assess water quality parameters in rural areas.
o	Educate users on water safety and suggest corrective measures.
o	Empower decision-makers (e.g., NGOs, local governments) with actionable insights through data aggregation and reporting.
o	Integrate predictive analytics to forecast potential water contamination issues.


2.	Features
o	User input for water quality parameters: pH, turbidity, contaminants.
o	Allow batch uploads for large scale data collection
o	Analysis of water quality based on WHO standards.
o	Recommendations for water treatment.
o	Data visualization for trends and insights.
o	Database integration for persistent storage.
o	Web interface for interaction and reporting.
o	Geolocation mapping for water sources
o	Mobile Compatibility i.e. can allow offline usage in areas where there is no network

     3.Technologies to be Used

     
•	Python: Core logic for water quality assessment.

•	Matplotlib/Ploty: For data visualization.

•	MySQL/PostgreSQL: To store and retrieve water quality data.

•	Django: To create a user-friendly web interface.

•	Automated alerts: notify users via email or SMS when water source is termed unsafe

•	Data import & export: Allow downloading reports as PDFs or CSV files

•	Audit Logs: Allow tracking all actions for transparency and accountability

•	User Authentication and roles: add user roles with permission to upload analyze and manage data

•	Community participation: implement a crowd-sourced data entry feature where field workers can upload water quality trends via the the phone and users can report water issues

•	Integration with IoT sensors: to monitor real-time water parameters and inaccurate manual data 
Entry

Multi-Language Support:



4. Views and Templates
   
Create views to:

1.	Input water quality data.
   
2.	Display analysis results.
	
3.	Show water quality trend
. 


5.Project Outcome

•	Users can assess water quality and get recommendations.

•	Trends can be visualized through charts.

•	Data is stored in a MySQL database and accessible via the Django interface.




C. Web Interface Workflow


1.	Input Water Data:
o	Create a form to input pH, turbidity, and contaminants with client-side validation.

2.	View Analysis:
o	The system processes data and displays an assessment.

3.	Visualization:
o	Generate interactive charts for water quality over time and by region.
o	Users can view trends in water quality for a selected source

4.	Download Reports:
o	Allow users to download analysis reports in PDF or Excel format.
